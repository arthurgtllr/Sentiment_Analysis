JN0tmjiksWfr4i2NIFuPXw,pLZ9oZM8c6MNbRlg06lBPg,1,3.0,2016-08-03,Las Vegas,"THEY SELL WRECKED VEHICLES! 
I purchased a 2010 Nissan Altima with 41,000 miles on it in 2013 from Planet Nissan. They charged me $18,000 and provided me with no warranty, except for manufacturer powertrain. Immediately after purchasing the vehicle I began having to make out of pocket repairs to the suspension, brakes and exhaust system every 6 to 9 months with absolutely no clue as to why after all the repairs the car still drove somewhat unsteady at high speeds. 
    Two years after I bought the car I was finally sick of the constant problems and decided to trade it in with another dealership, during the trade in process I found out that Planet Nissan had sold the vehicle to me knowing that it was involved in a ""major"" car accident which caused frame damage six months prior to them selling it to me.
Unfortunately there's not much I can do now, but I would advise any savvy consumer to avoid this dealership by all means possible and go someplace that is a bit more reputable!",Auto Repair;Car Dealers;Automotive;Auto Parts & Supplies

a few months ago I slammed.my truck into a curb. I destroyed the wheel and rim. took the truck to Discount tire to get replacements, which they were able to do. They got a factory rim and a new tire the following day. It could have been same day but the I had miss there delivery from the dealership. 

I took it to get it aligned across the street and they said they did the best they could. They're best was well really bad the stirring wheel if you hold it straight the truck would go straight but if you left go the house whole truck went to the left. 

Discount Tire told me they recommend going to Quality Star down rancho. we brought it to them. Later that day they said it would be bout 500 for a control arm thats cracked. But it's still pulling so they need to work on it. Later that same day they called and said it would be another hundred and something for another part. they were really sorry but they are trying to fix it but they keep find problems.  We went down to pay and see it is was down. when we got there they were test driving it. but told me the bill was now eight hundred and something. I was annoyed but just wanted my truck fixed. however when they were done with the test drive he said it's better but not perfect and ask for more time. we let them keep it a few more days but  when we would call for updates it was just a run around. 
I had a gut feeling something was wrong so we went down and said we just want the truck back. they gave us a speech about how it's a process and we should turn it into insurance because the whole front end on the passenger side needs to be replaced. I said hell no and took my truck home on the way I noticed if you hold the wheel level it now went to the left and it you let go it quick pulled to the right. so I had to fight to keep it straight.

we called a relative worried bout the truck and not sure where to go or what to do. 
He told me to take it to Arrow Alignment and they would take a look. He sends all his customers there that have issues  with there alignments. 
We made an appointment and took it in this morning. They are pretty far from me. the Mechanic talked to us for a few minutes and asked for some background about the problem. 
he said the give him about an hour. 
I went back to work fearing another big bill. but thankfully that didn't happen. I went down and he said he fixed it. that it was the alignment and also the wheel as it had worn wrong because of how I had been having to drive it.

bJN2ZPa0jF4xgR1gPKZP3A,hCXknMQalY1QQZrdZGuBHg,3,3.5,2017-01-24,Las Vegas,"I have mixed feelings here. I recently purchased an XJ not from here. They had one that was a great price and I test drove it and man Jag does know how to make a smooth ride. However, I was trading in a ram truck and the dealership wanted to lowball me on the trade because of the tax credit. It's frustrating to me as I am not a novice to buying cars I have bought and sold 50 plus cars. So I did my research and math before I came here. I knew what the trade value was on my truck, but of course the dealership says they don't use blue book, black book, edmonds or nada which is fine I don't expect full trade value but they came in 5 k less. When I told the sales me what another dealership offered he told me to go there. So I did and bought an Xj from them and sold my truck. 

However, there was an issue with the seat heater. For some reason, it only worked when the car was in park. No worry's I took it to this dealership's service department as it had factory warranty on it and was covered. I explained the problem and left my car. The service rep was very nice and helpful, made me feel very welcomed and valued, unlike the sales person. 

They called me a few days later saying there's no issue with the heater and I can come get it. They said they turned the car on and tested it with a thermometer and it heats up fine. I told them that I know it works with the car is in park, but I don't drive around in park. So I asked them to read the notices that the service rep made when I explained how to recreate the issue and call me when its fixed. 

A week later and they are replacing the heater unit. 
All in all I have very mixed feelings as the service level I received is so up and down.",Car Dealers;Auto Repair;Automotive

cIeF6K2kjNNkJ2pMKrGztA,Gxu3_yzEAXKtkBB0YpnvlQ,1,1.5,2009-07-19,Peoria,"Last weekend I decided to go on a hunt to see if I could find a deal worthy of trading in my current car for a newer model. I went to two dealerships because one I was familiar with and closer to my home, and the other had the exact car I wanted. I should have never made that second trip.

I already put car salesman at a lower bar than other people in my mind, but this was a whole new level of low. If you don't want to end your day wanting to staple things to people's heads, I would stay away from this dealership.

I walked into the dealership knowing what I wanted. I still wanted to browse first, but I had researched. This is also not my first car buying experience, and not my first Mazda. I am well aware of the line. Oh yeah, and I'm also a car fanatic. 

I didn't mind being hunted down by a salesman right away because I had really already knew what I wanted. It was coincidental that without saying what I wanted, the first car he decided to show me was the one I had seen in their online inventory. 

Soon enough I was on a test drive. Great car as expected. I asked some simple questions such as if I could have more details on the specifics of the particular perimeter alarm that was installed on that car to which the salesman did not have an answer. Makes me think it would have been fun to ask him what was under the hood.

We all know that what comes next is the fun part. And by fun, I mean extremely annoying process that takes 10 times longer than it should - the negotiating process. The first part was estimating the trade in value of my car though he decided to wrap this up in the first round of pricing negotiations. Right off the bat I was undercut by a couple grand at least on my trade in. Not cool. 

I told him that the trade in value wasn't acceptable and asked if I could find out the specific price plan I was eligible for to which I received a blank look. I would expect a dealership employee to know the various standard pricing plans. I also let him know I wanted to know what other offers were available. After waiting awhile, he came back with no change in the trade in, but did give me the pricing plan I was eligible for.

Since it was still not where it needed to be, I explained to him what I was looking for. I told him my situation and that I did not need to buy a new car. I told him that my car was perfectly fine and in amazing condition and that I wasn't desperate. I let him know the price I had gotten down to at another dealership and where I ideally wanted to be. I said I didn't want to play negotiation games and I wanted to know how close he could get me.

Things quickly got out of line. I was treated with great disrespect as I was given excuse after excuse and attack after attack. At one point he recommended I lease and when I explained to him I did not want to lease I was given a rant of how I don't put enough miles on my car and it's stupid for me to buy. Really? Okay. I'm out then. If that wasn't enough I was also attacked for asking what the lowest price was. I was asked if I wanted the company to lose money all while he kept informing me that he gets paid on commission, which goes by the number of cars he sells. I guess maybe I looked like I didn't know how car dealerships worked and how the car buying process goes. At one point he asked again where I wanted to be payment wise, to which I told him. He then put a range down on a scrap piece of paper with an x and a line below it and told me to sign. When I said I wasn't comfortable signing a scrap piece of paper below a payment price range without any detail or further information, he became very agitated.

In the end I let him know that this wasn't going anywhere and that I didn't think the price was going to be where I needed it to be. I told him that with the economy the way it is, that I figured the price would be lower. When I purchased my other car in a much better economy I was able to get a better deal. I asked if I could have my pricing plan certificate back and was given a very sarcastic, ""You can have whatever you want.""

I was so repulsed by the way I was treated. I emailed customer service at the dealership and never received a response. I cannot believe they would ignore a situation like this, though with the only other review being a 1, I am not that surprised anymore. 

Slightly more detail is available on my blog, but I didn't want to write a novel here unless it was wanted. Oops I guess I already did :)",Car Dealers;Automotive;Auto Repair
7Je9L6bqTSBd4Ah9M3rvDw,C2VIYAElOUer5rBZH71c_A,5,4.5,2012-10-06,Phoenix,"What a difference a new location with more space makes. I now kinda feel like I make up reasons to bring my car in so I can cowork at the awesome desk in the new sexy space 180 just moved into. Headlight out? 180 should be able to fix that. I feel like my exhaust pipe may be loose but I may simply be paranoid? 180 can check that for me. I don't like the song on the radio? 180 can fix that (well probably not, but I can still cowork while they amuse me).

The fact that there are more bays also means my typical maintenance gets done so much quicker too. I've been able to get in and out of the shop in an hour or so. And there's space to sit there. And a desk!!!!! A real desk. So I can sit down and be an adult and connect to the VPN and do all that work stuff. 

And the rest of the stuff I've always loved has still stayed the same. It's locally owned by and operated by some kick ass women. They always tell me what's going on with my car in a completely no bullshit, non-condescending way. The prices are reasonable. And they are very friendly. Most importantly, they truly care. 

Oh and, they're reusable cups they give as presents are amazing and well designed. Love!

IQwRbPB5OZRuGyOQ7pSbjw,hh4fbhrp5x50P8wAbRwADw,3,2.5,2011-04-30,Phoenix,"This review is being occasionally brought to you by Showcase Mazda service lobby wifi. Kinda. Because it took 20 minutes for it to work. But we seem to be okay now. Hopefully I can get through this.

Now that I have that off my chest I have to say I'm confused. Why? Because, according to yelp, the Mazda dealership near 16th St & Camelback brands its service department under a completely different name. But I have never experience that in my contact with them or mailings I receive. It's always been Camelback Mazda. Alas, I am getting service, so I guess this is the company I need to file it under.

After being here a few times, I have to say it's pretty much so-so. The first time I was here, I had an amazing experience with the service department. Iain was fantastic and told me what was up and showed me what was going on. I hate when mechanics and service staff just assume I'm gonna throw money at them without understanding the issue. It's crazy. He also gave me a loaner car when it was going to be longer than expected, which I truly appreciate. Granted it was a horrid orange Subaru wagon\/SUV thing that was SO not my Mazda, but it worked.

This time, I'm a little less optimistic. The time it took me to even get my car into service was a nightmare. I sat there while some typing was going on and questions were asked that should've been in my record and on my appointment (like WTF I'm getting done). Other Mazda dealerships I've been to have had that ready when I got there. I just review sign, and go hop to my coworking. The end. Get with it. It took 15 minutes for my car to even get back there. Maybe I should get here 20 minutes early next time. 

However, the lobby if you need to wait is fantastic. I always choose to sit and wait because it gives me time to catch up on things, like yelp reviews. There's a TV, some couches, high tables to sit and work at, wifi, popcorn, coffee, soda, and slushies. Oh and this great photo wall of people kayaking. I uploaded it so you don't miss out.

Overall not too bad, but time will tell how consistent the check-in procedure is.",Car Dealers;Automotive;Auto Repair

I have come here for every little item I needed done and have never felt cheated or had the blanket pulled over my eyes. There have been a few things where I was expecting a HUGE bill for things like the stabilizer for my rear suspension that had been slightly bent. I bought a new one and brought it in thinking well Labor will be $100. Zimbrick got me right in, said it would take an hour, had it out in half an hour and didn't charge me a dime. Another time I have come in expecting to replace all my breaks and rotors and Zimbrick saved me about $300 without having to replace everything. 

I have worked with a few guys here and they have ALL been extremely professional and treated me like family. The guy I usually go to even just chats with me about cars and such while i'm having service done. (Mainly getting my oil changed). The facility itself is nothing less than perfection, in my opinion, when it comes to dealerships. It is clean, well layed out, they have a great lounge with a Big Screen TV, leather chairs, FREE WIFI, and the best of all... Free Starbucks Coffee. I have had nothing but great experiences from Zimbrick and not just Zimbrick Acura. However, BECAUSE of Zimbrick Acura I expect to buy another Acura and stay with them for a VERY very long time. Thank you Zimbrick Acura! YOU GUYS ARE THE BEST OF THE BEST.

Then Gerber actually paid another shop to repair my car properly. That was after I filed complaints to the BBB and with Geico. By the way. The on site Geico rep at the shop does not care how the repairs are done. He probably gets a kickback from the shop.

They could not align my rear bumper properly. They could not install the spoiler flush on the trunk. They painted the deck lid (trunk) and then sat it on the floor while it was drying. The paint was chipped all around the edges. The manager actually told me that everyone else would take the car the way it was. He thought I was nit picking.

The reason I am writing this review a year latter is because I was looking at my drivers side quarter panel yesterday with the a guy from another body shop, he showed me what a poor paint job they did at Gerber when they blended the paint together. You can't really notice it unless someone points it out to you, but that is not the point. It was not blended properly and it looks terrible.

His appointment was at 1, and mine was at 2. I showed up with my car at 2PM and my husband was still waiting for them to finish up with his car. We sat together in the waiting area, and within 20 minutes my car was pulled around and my maintenance was done.

We asked when my husband's car would be ready and were told ""in just a few minutes"". We waited, and waited, and waited some more. No one could tell us what the delay was. Finally, at 2:45, after waiting an hour and 45 minutes, I pointedly asked what was taking so long. They couldn't tell us. Several customers had come and gone in the time it took us to wait for my husband's car.

At 2:55, after a nearly two hour wait, they FINALLY took my husband's car down and brought it around. When he inquired (again!) as to why it took so long they said they had issues with a latch on his battery (he'd asked them to check that, since there was a loose connector issue).  

They gave us $20 off his service for the extended wait, which we appreciated for the time we had to wait, but they should have communicated with us about what was taking so long.

The first few times I cane here it was an awesome experience. Now they have a service guy and he was just awful. He pressured me a ton to upgrade to synthetic oil for my oil change and even had me sign a waiver that I'm not using the ""recommended"" oil and told me that my engine might blow up because of it. I hate it when I feel pressured like that, especially at a car service place as a woman. The worst part was that he kept coming back into the waiting room with really intimidating and aggressive behavior. One time he came in and asked who did my last oil change. When I explained this place did, he turned around and walked back into work on my car. The next time he came back into the waiting room I asked, "" what was that about?"" And he said ""nothing."" I said ""wait a minute it's kind of alarming when someone asks you a something like that!"" He said ""oh just something wasn't put back the way it was supposed to be."" I was like what the heck!! I'm sure if I had said I went to another place we would've given me another more dramatic response. During this experience I was the only customer and he was the only employee at Lightning Lube. I definitely don't think he'd have act this way if his supervisor was around. 

Because I had such a great experience the two previous times I came for oil changes I decided to give this place one last shot. When I pulled in I immediately saw that same employee so I did a U-turn and got the hell out of there. I'd be willing to give this place another shot but I refuse to work with that same guy.

We bought a Pick Up truck from this dealership in May of this year I was concerned about the transmission on the truck since it appeared to be a work truck with an after market towing package installed which means it may have done a lot of towing and I wanted to look at other trucks, Marisol our sales person who was very nice assured me the truck had been inspected by a their mechanic and nothing was wrong with the transmission or engine..and they gave us a we owe to have the serpentine belt replaced and oil change and spare tire put on front passenger side cause it was suppose to be in better shape then the one on the truck (it wasn't), the second day we had the truck the fuel pump went out they took it to their mechanic and had it fixed and had the we owe work done and we then went to pick it up from the address in Maryvale (thats how we found out about the mechanic working out his backyard)...After that we had to have 4 new shocks put on and 4 new tires (all 4 according to tire shop were rotted from the heat so truck sat for a long time) and the fuel system cleaned since their mechanic didnt do that when he changed the fuel pump and some other things that were little and not real important but should have been taken care of before they put it on the lot for sale,  then the  first payment came due to finance first week of June we made the payment early and a week later the transmission gave out completely.  We talked with our finance company who said either they (Network) need to fix it or they would unwind our deal and put our loan towards another vehicle at one of their other vendors.  On 7\/23\/2016 Network came and towed our truck to their transmission shop to have it fixed I left messages last week trying to get an update, today I finally talk to Edward who tells me that they went ahead and had transmission rebuilt and it was $1250.00 which they would only pay $725.00 of I told him well I did not agree to that and he knows it so I would not be picking up the truck nor paying any of the bill and that I would call back our finance company fill them in and we will go with our option of unwinding this deal.  Now we are letting our finance company handle it from there with Network and we are meeting with a lawyer to see about suing for down payment back, between the down payment and the repairs we made on that truck for 30 days we had it we are out $2400 dollars and don't even have the vehicle.

So this Monday my car was back at the service department for a fuel pump sensor. They called and quoted me over $500 for a $30 part. No thanks, so i paid the $120 for them to go throughout my car to see if anything else was wrong with it. Final report: new brake pads =$400, fine. NOTHING else was said on the paper work, NOTHING.

Flash forward two days, 10 pm at night driving 70 mph in the fast lane on the 95. My right front tire sounds like is about to fall off.. so i pull off the freeway (going 10 mph) to see if i had a flat. My boyfriends father comes to my rescue since he used to work at the speedway. My tire had RIPPED IN HALF!!! The metal braiding inside of it was wrapped around my rim. Come to find out ALL 4 of my tires were COMPLETELY bald! $600 later for new tires...

My question is: HOW COULD THEY NOT HAVE TOLD ME???? I paid them $120 for what! And on top of that i could have been killed if i did not stop right away when i heard the noise (quoting the tow driver). I would never ever let this company touch a car again!

I brought my car in after I got a dead battery and auto zone said it could be the alternator.

I arrived at 7 am with no appointment and was greeted immediately in the service drive and a service advisor welcomed me and got my info.  He noted on the paper I was waiting.

About 20 minutes after waiting he comes back and asks if I'm the second owner on the car... Which I tell him no I bought it at the bell dealership.  He says ""when I put in your VIN it says Eric so-and-so"" which I say he must have a typo. 

After 40 more minutes he comes back with my battery quote $8 over auto zone with $68 to install.  I told the service advisor, Larry that he is putting me in an awkward spot since that is a ridiculous fee to install the battery since auto zone is cheaper?  He says ""well guess you shoulda done that"" and then even said ""well who is going to install it??""  I'm pretty sure everyone knows Autozone will install batteries- why does Larry have to treat me like I'm completely ignorant?  He made my jaw drop at his comments and his lack of customer service.  I'd hate to see him negotiating an actual substantial service bill!

Bought the car, drove off the lot and saw that the right blinker was out. Took it back to the dealership because we hadn't left the area yet. 

Eric, our sales guy took it to the back for 5-8 minutes and brought it back to the front and said, ""They didn't even have to change the bulb."" 

I asked what the issue was and he said it might have been the cold weather or what have you. Cool. Thought nothing of it.

Until LATER that night, our blinker was out again.

I decided to make an appointment to have it checked out. I took it to a Certified dealer on my side of town. The warranty that we have is a joke - that's #1. #2, not sure if the first dealership was honest with us. If they looked at it, they would have seen the issue. #3, we had to pay half ($92) because a light bulb was out and ""is not covered by warranty"". So essentially, we had to pay $92 because a light bulb was ""out"". Weird though because the guy at the dealership previously said, ""We didn't even have to change the light bulb."" Hmmm.

Not going to accuse them of shady practices but let's just say next time I have an issue with my car (aside from huge issues like engine, transmission, etc.). I will be going else where.

Please go visit mike he has great customer service this is the only body shop I will be visiting from now on. Definitely 5 stars.

I bought my tires from discount tire on w 130th I suggest visiting conrad's before you go anywhere else. I bet you can't beat their prices",Oil Change Stations;Tires;Automotive;Auto Repair

However one person stood out the most Gabby DeLeon ! She treated us like family she helped entertain my kids in a stressful time. She went out of her way to make sure al was good and organized for us! Even after we drove off with our car she still went out her way to follow up and make sure that we are happy!",Auto Repair;Car Dealers;Automotive

They never make me wait long and you never have to call ahead (for flat fixes). Super friendly.,Auto Repair;Automotive;Transmission Repair;Tires

Did inspection, emissions, and oil change on both cars plus a repair on one of them. That was a little over 2 months ago and the cars are running smoothly. Prices were extremely affordable, especially compared to the corporate ""quick oil change"" places. Lookin at you, Jiffy Lube. They didn't do or recommend anything I didn't need and they didn't treat me differently for being a woman (yes, that still happens to me everywhere else I go for auto care). No question they are my auto shop from here on out!",Automotive;Auto Repair
